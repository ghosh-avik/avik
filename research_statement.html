<h1>Research overview</h1>
<p>My research interests include <b>controls</b>, <b>optimization</b>, and <b>machine learning (ML)</b> for efficient microgrid 
operation with high penetration of renewables/EVs/batteries, with additional interests in <b>heat transfer</b> 
and <b>HVAC-R</b> systems.</p>
<p>My current research involves designing algorithms for enabling smooth operation of mobile charging station (MCS) 
assisted construction electric vehicles (CEVs). Broadly, our goal is to build ML models for predicting 
the energy requirement of different construction activities, and designing spatio-temporal optimization 
algorithms to ensure that the CEVs have enough charge to complete their construction while allowing for cost-efficient 
charging of the MCS from the main grid. The goal is to reduce both operating costs and carbon emissions as compared to 
conventional diesel operated construction vehicles.</p>
<p>My PhD research addressed the question: <i>‘How can microgrids with high variable renewable energy
(VRE) penetration and dispatchable energy resources &ndash; such as electric vehicles (EVs) and battery energy
storage systems (BESS) &ndash; be operated in the most economical way to reduce monthly electricity bills?'</i> The 
core idea is for microgrid operators to leverage 'smart' charging/discharging and load shifting &ndash; through 
strategies such as <a href="https://pknergypower.com/what-is-peak-shaving-and-valley-filling/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>valley filling and peak-shaving</a> 
to cut costs. This helps both the customer, i.e., the microgrid operator (by cutting costs) and the entire grid 
at large (by avoiding costly grid infrastructure updates).</p>

<div id="text-container"></div></div>
<p>Towards this goal, I developed computationally inexpensive real-time operation algorithms for 
BESS/EV dispatch, along with analytical frameworks for estimating optimal EV charging benefits. My developed 
methods use techniques from <b>convex optimization</b>, <b>economic model predictive control</b>, and <b>chance constrained 
optimization</b>, and are backed by both rigorous theoretical guarantees, and simulations on realistic microgrid data 
and tariff profiles.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, many eons ago as an undergrad, I worked on <a href="https://articsolar.com/solar-desiccant-cooling-systems/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>solar desiccant cooling</a> systems for hot and humid
tropical/subtropical areas of the world as a replacement for conventional air conditioners. 
The core idea was to first treat hot and humid air by a hygroscopic substance such a liquid desiccant 
(e.g., lithium chloride), which absorbs its moisture, and then cool the air by an indirect evaporative cooler,
which reduces its temperature before supplying it to the conditioned space. The liquid desiccant is returned 
back to its concentrated form by evaporating the trapped moisture using solar thermal energy. I would again like to 
work on similar problems at the intersection of heat transfer/fluid mechanics and controls in the near future.</p>
<h2>Research agenda</h2>
<p>Borrowing from <a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Aaditya Ramdas</a> at CMU, I <b>try</b> and <b>aim</b> to be 
a <i>'practical theorist'</i>, where the crux of my work focuses on developing algorithms with strong 
theoretical guarantees, but are simple/inexpensive enough to be used in practice. While the sustainability 
agenda heavily influences my work, I am mesmerized (which, I must admit took some time to appreciate) by 
the elegant mathematics and generality that the field of systems and controls offers &#8201;&mdash;&#8201; and in this way, I am 
also broadly interested in all aspects of <i>control of dynamical systems</i>, and <i>decision making under uncertainty</i>. </p>
<h2>Inspiration and mission</h2>
<p>I grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Kolkata</a> in the 2000s. Over my lifetime, as in much of India, 
the quality of life of my city's residents has improved rapidly &#8201;&mdash;&#8201; but rapid growth has also brought visible downsides:
pollution, traffic congestions, and inefficient trash/waste management. I am no 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusianism" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Malthusian</a>, and I believe a lot of these problems will alleviate as India continues to develops more 
and moves further into the middle income 
status. My goal is to contribute to that progress by tackling important problems in my areas of interest 
and helping build a workforce equipped to meet the demands of the future.</p>
<p>While poverty alleviation aided by fast growth is of utmost importance, the rising carbon footprint, 
and (sometimes) unnecessary consumerism of the modern world 
deeply concerns me. I hope that 
through my research, someday, I will be able to effect some (small) change in the quest towards the transformation 
to a majorly clean(er) energy powered future. If India is able to sustainably develop, it will be an inspiration 
for the rest of the developing world.</p>
<p>I am deeply interested in and try to learn about ancient Indic philosophy which, in spirit, guides my actions and research.</p>
